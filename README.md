# Instagram Web API

## Project Description
The **Instagram Web API** is a Node.js library that allows developers to interact with Instagram's web endpoints for automation and data retrieval. This API handles login, fetching user data, and managing posts, all without relying on the official mobile API or requiring the use of Selenium.

## TODO
- [ ] Fetch user details, posts, stories, and more.
- [ ] Perform actions like following, liking, and commenting.
- [ ] Handles CSRF token and session management automatically.
- [ ] Lightweight and easy to integrate into other projects.
